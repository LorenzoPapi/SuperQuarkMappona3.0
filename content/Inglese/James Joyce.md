### Themes and style
***Paralysis*** is a recurrent theme: it is both **physical** (external forces) and **moral** (religion, politics, culture). However, the moral centre of the collection is the **revelation of is** to its victims, and in particular the **failure of finding a way out of it**. Climax is reached by **self-realization** and **awareness**: the desire to **escape** originates from an **impulse caused by the sense of confinement** that many experience, but nobody can **overcome**. This manifestation is called ***epiphany*** and it's caused by objects or situations.
Every story is told by the **perspective of a character** and starts in ***medias res***. The characters themselves are **presented through introspection**, making time subjective, and in particular:
- **free indirect speech** is used when the **thoughts are presented directly** through limited mediation by the narrator
- **free direct speech** allows the reader to **acquire direct knowledge of the character's mind**: language **breaks down** into a **succession of words** without punctuation or grammatical connections
Linguistic registry is varied and depends on **age, social class and role**, descriptions are **realistic and concise**, but realism is often mixed with **symbolism**, giving deeper meaning to external details.
