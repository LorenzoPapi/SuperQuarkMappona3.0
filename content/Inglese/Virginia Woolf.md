# Ideology
She was interested in **giving voice** to the **inner world of feeling and memory**: the *events* of a story are much less important than the ***impression*** they left on the **who experienced them**.
In her essay ***A Sketch of the Past***, she wonders why **some events are very powerful and memorable** and she concludes that there are two kinds of experiences:
- moments of **being**, which are acts **experienced intensely and with awareness**
- moments of **non-being**, in which the individual **isn't consciously aware**
The **intensity** of the feeling and one's **consciousness** separate the two moments, of which the former causes the individual to realize her **connection to a larger pattern**.

`A woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction.`
## Mrs Dalloway
### Plot
The entire book takes place over **one day** in the middle of **June 1923**. It is almost plotless since the action happens in the **character's mind**. It tells the interwoven stories of **Clarissa Dalloway** and **war veteran Septimus Warren Smith**. At 10 a.m., Clarissa goes to buy flowers for the party she is giving that evening and, while she's in the shop, a **car makes an explosive noise** and a **plane writes in the sky**, causing various reactions in people; in the meantime, Septimus and his wife **Lucrezia** are walking. However, Septimus' **shell-shock** kicked in and necessitated the call of **Dr Holmes** and **Sir William Bradshaw** who brings him to a **psychiatric hospital**, but at 6 p.m. he **throws himself out of the window** and gets impaled by a fence, wanting to be free. The news of Septimus' suicide is **discussed by the guests**, but only Clarissa shows compassion for the dead man's suffering.
### Setting and characters
The modern technology portrayed in the book represents **London rushing towards modernity**: the **striking of the Big Ben** is used to mark a **turning point** in the novel, but also let the reader flow from the **inner to the outer reality**.
She **digs into the characters' past** creating tunnels which **connect at a specific moment** in the narrative. The two stories of Clarissa and Septimus are **parallel**:
- Clarissa is a **woman of 51**, married to the **conservative MP Richard Dallow** who holds **traditional views on women's rights**, thus leading to Clarissa's **internal contrast** between the **need for freedom** and her **class consciousness**. She lives life trying to **achieve order and peace**, but this effort led her to a **form of depression**
- Septimus is a **sensitive man** who loves poetry and is **shell-shocked** after seeing the **death of his best friend** during WW1
The two characters can be seen as **doubles** as they both **rely on their partner for stability** and they also respond to **experience in physical terms**. They both also think about **death** and see **world's beauty**, however Septimus is led to **kill himself**, while Clarissa seems **ready to go on**.
### Differences with [[James Joyce|Joyce]]
While he shows his characters thoughts through **interior monologue**, she always **maintains logical and grammatical coherence**. Joyce is more interested in **experimenting with language**, while she uses **poetic words** full of **emotions and allusions**. Her "moments of beings" are similar to Joyce's "epiphanies".
