## Ideology (Aestheticism)
Traditional Victorian values were **challenged by Aestheticism** whose motto was _**“Art for Art’s Sake”**_, implying that art had **nothing to do with morality** and didn’t have to be **didactic**. Aesthetes wanted to **praise the sensuality of art** and the **sensation of pleasure it created**, going against the **ethics** of Victorian values. In literature, **Walter Pater** is regarded as the **main theorist**: he **rejected religion** saying that **only art could stop time** and thought that life had to be lived **in the spirit of art**, filling each moment with **intense experiences**. The artist was the **transcriber of the world’s sense**.

## Works

#### Plot
Dorian is a **beautiful young man** who fascinates the painter **Basil Hallward**, at the point where he decides to **paint his portrait**. Under the influence of **brilliant Lord Henry Wotton**, Dorian **throws himself** in a life of pleasure, having **everything he wants**, including eternal youth. The **signs of age** do not appear on his body but **on the portrait**. He **uses everyone**, letting **people die** all for his own desires. When the painter sees the **corrupted image** of the painting, **Dorian kills him**, but later he wants to **free himself** from the curse and **stabs the painting**. In doing so he **kills himself** and at the very moment of his death the **picture returns to its purity** while his face becomes **“withered and wrinkled”**.
#### Meaning
The main characters are symbols of certain values:
- Dorian is the **ideal of youth**, **beauty** and **innocence** who are **immortalized by art**: morally, he’s neither black nor white, but **Gray**, living a life of **pleasure** but in the end **ruining himself.**
- Lord Henry is an **amoral aesthete**: he **criticizes institutions** and believes **youth is the most important value**, negatively influencing Dorian.
- Basil Hallward is an **artist** who is **obsessed by Dorian’s beauty** and is **killed** when he tries to bring Dorian back to a **good moral conduct**.
#### Themes and narration style
The themes are those of **beauty** and **appearance** as the **ultimate values in life**, from which emerges the **Faustian pact** between Dorian and the painting and the theme of the **double**: while Dorian **appears good and beautiful**, he’s the **most spiritually corrupted man** in the world, symbolizing the **Victorian middle class**. The story is told by an **impersonal third-person narrator** and characters are defined by **their actions**.
## Links
**Art**: aestheticism and [[Impressionismo|impressionism]] are strictly related to each other, both chronologically and for their ideal of considering art a reality in itself.
**Italian**: it's impossible not to see the analogies between Oscar Wilde's masterpiece and [[D'Annunzio]]'s work "Il piacere", both heavily influenced by the philosophy of Aestheticism.
