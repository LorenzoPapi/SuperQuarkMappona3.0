Growing up, she becomes a **teacher** at the school but later accepts the job at **Thornfield Hall** as a **governess** for **Mr Rochester**’s daughter, Adele. After sometime there she **falls in love with the owner** of the house: some strange events happen in the meantime. After spending a while on her aunt’s deathbed she comes back and **Rochester confesses his love to her** and they agree to marry: two nights before the marriage however she **sees a figure standing by her bed** and her **dress is torn apart**. The marriage is then interrupted by **Richard Mason** who declares that Mr Rochester is already married to **his sister Bertha** who lives on the **attic** of the house and is looked after by **Grace Poole**. Jane **leaves Thornfield** and goes to live with her cousins at **Moor House** where she meets **St John Rivers** who plans to **marry her**: she **refuses** and one night she hears Rochester’s voice calling her, causing her **comeback to Thornfield** only to see that a **fire destroyed** the house and that **Bertha died** while Mr Rochester lost his eyesight. He now lives in **Ferndean** and Jane decides to **marry him**.
### Setting
The novel takes place in **five different locations** and in the **early 19<sup><b>th</b></sup> century** and each place is linked to a **stage of her life**:
1) **Gateshead** is the place of her childhood where she **lives unhappily** but gains her **ethical consciousness**,
2) **Lowood Institution** is the place of her **education** and a **miserable time** of her life,
3) **Thornfield** is where Jane finds **love** and **temptation**,
4) **Moor House** is where she tries to **give her life a new meaning**,
5) **Ferndean** is where she **starts a new, matured love**.
### Characters
Jane is an **assertive heroine** who tries to **find herself** and often speaks **against dominant male figures**, she is **rebellious**, **independent**, the opposite of a Victorian woman, but she also needs **warmth** and **affection**.
Mr Rochester is a **Byronic hero**, but his figure of the **seducer** becomes a **nobleman of passion**, attracted to Jane's personality rather than her looks.
Bertha Mason is a **threatening presence** and she's described as a **monster**, even if she's parallel to Jane: they're both **imprisoned** in a room, have a **relationship with Rochester** and are **marginalised** from society. She also acts as **double** because she's what Jane is **afraid of**.
### Themes and style
The theme of **childhood** and **education** are important, especially in the chapters that deal with the **transition from childhood to adulthood**. Also the **role of woman** is central alongside the **passionate love** described by a woman's perspective, who is a **human being worthy of value**.

The story is told in **first person** so everything is seen from **Jane's POV**, who often **talks to the reader directly**, explaining her thoughts. There are also **symbols** and **image** taken from the **Gothic style** to explore **strange states of mind**.
