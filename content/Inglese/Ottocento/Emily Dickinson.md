# Biography (Amherst, 1830 - Amherst,  1886)
Born into a **middle-class Puritan family**, she attended university where she **refused to declare her faith** in public, as required, and interrupted her studies. She started a secluded life and never left her fatherâ€™s house if not for some walks in the garden. She only wore **white clothes** as symbols of spiritual marriage and singleness. She spent her time with members of the family and **few friends** to which she wrote letters, her only contact with the world: her poems were written for **communication**, not publication.
# Works
During her life, Emily wrote nearly **2000 poems** but allowed only 7 to be printed. A posthumous selection of her work was made and ***Poems*** by Emily Dickinson (1890) appeared with some changes to suit the taste of the public. Complete original editions of her letters and poems were published in the 1950s.

She deals with **universal themes** like **soul**, **love**, **time**, **death** and uses **natural elements** to **emphasize** themes. She **rejected traditional patterns** and fills her poetry with **questions** rather than **propositions**: usually they are **short poems** of **simple quatrains**, characterized by **monosyllabic words**. Images are detracted from sources like **law**, **geometry** and **engineering**: she uses **punctuation** to create **pauses** and **convey emotions**.
## Ideology
Her mind was shaped by **Puritanism** and **Transcendentalism**: her poetry inspired by the **great poets** of the past. Unlike **Whitman** who dealt with the **American experience**, she presented a **total vision of inner and outer experiences** that drives the **individual**, celebrating life despite its **dualism** of **hope** and **despair**.
## I dwell in Possibility
The poem explores the use of **Poetry as a mean of escape** from ordinary existence: it's considered more **versatile and beautiful than Prose** because it can connect the individual to the **complete reality** that surrounds him.
