### Plot
The story talks about the **Morel family**: **Gertrude** is **clever** and literate, while her husband is an **uneducated coal miner**. Due to their class difference, disputes are daily. Mrs Morel devotes **all her love** to her children, in particular to the **talented Paul**. However, this unsettling relationship makes him **reject Miriam, his first girlfriend** and then abandon her because she doesn't want any **physical relation** with him. Later, he starts another relationship with **Clara Dawes**, married woman and *Suffragette*, but he soon realises that **she's not the one**. Meanwhile, his mother **dies of cancer** but Paul, after thinking about **suicide**, achieves in shaking off his past and starting a **new life**.
### Characters
Paul's psychological development is **closely influenced by his family**:
- Mr Morel is **violent**, leading his children to become **protective of their mother**,
- Mrs Morel's **love** prevents them from **having a fulfilling relationship**,
- Paul is unable to choose a woman because of its constant **love and hate for all women in his life**,
- Miriam is the **religious woman** who is abandoned because of her **spirituality**,

### Themes and narration style
An important theme is the [[Sigmund Freud#^dacee3|Oedipus complex]], presented both through **Paul's love for his mother** and in reverse. The **opposition body-mind** is used to expose the **contradictory nature of desire**, which makes characters pair up with someone who **isn't like them**. Also, the contrast between **industrial civilisation** with its **artificial aspects**, and **nature**, primarily shown through **sexual instinct**, which he considered to be the **strongest** and the only way to save humanity from self-destruction.

As its seen from the novel, Lawrence considered women **only as an instrument for mankind's happiness**: the female characters are **sensitive girls** who are aware of the **otherness** of their partner, whose **intellectual and sexual supremacy** they accept.

The novel is told with a **third-person narrator** but all the events are seen **through Paul's eyes**. Characters are portrayed by **showing and telling** and their feelings are revealed by **words and images** related to the senses.
