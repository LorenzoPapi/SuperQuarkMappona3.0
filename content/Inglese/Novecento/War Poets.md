World War I inspired a whole generation of **young poets** who became a **collective voice** dealing not only with the **horrors of modern warfare**, but also with **hopes and disappointment** of an entire generation. Their poems use **violent everyday language** in an unconventional style.
# Rupert Brooke
## Biography (1887 - April 1915)
Born in a wealthy family, he was a **handsome good student and athlete** at King's College in Cambridge. Becoming popular in the **Fabian Society**, he got to know many important figures before the war. After WW1 broke out, he **enlisted in the Royal Navy**, but died some years later because of **septicaemia**.
## Works
His best known work is the sequence of **five war sonnets** called ***1914 and Other Poems***, in which he claimed that **war is clean and cleansing**, believing that dying in a war is **honorable**, showing a **sentimental attitude**. He became a symbol of the **young romantic hero** who inspired **patriotism** in the early months of the Great War.
# Wilfred Owen
## Biography (1893 - 4th November 1918)
Born in a middle class family, he visited a **hospital for wounded soldiers** while he was working as a **English teacher** in **France** (1915) and decided to go back to England and **enlist**. He was sent to the **Somme** (1916) where, after being **hit by a shell**, he spent various days sheltering in a hole near the **corpse of a fellow officer**. After he was diagnosed with **shell shock**, he was sent to an hospital to recover (1917) where he met **Siegfried Sassoon**, patient and poet, who encouraged Owen to **continue writing**. After returning to the front (August 1918), he was **killed** in a German machine gun attack.
## Works
In June 1918 he wrote the **preface** to his collection, ***Disabled and Other Poems***:
```
This book is not about heroes. [...]
My subject is War, and the pity of War.
The Poetry is in the pity. [...] All a poet can do today is warn.
```
Owen sees its own work as a **warning to future generations**, which is all he can do, by **accurately describing the war**: gas casualties, mind-lost soldiers, brutal mass killings. The frequent use of **alliteration** and **assonance** give the lines a **moral force**. He also introduced **"pararhymes"**, which contributed to the effect of **disharmony**.
### *Dulce et Decorum Est*
It describes a **gas attack**, in which a soldier **dies of agony** because he couldn't put on a mask in time. The title is a quotation from the Latin poet **Horace**, who borrowed it from the Greek **Tyrtaeus**: in the poem, the title's phrase, `Dulce et Decorum Est Pro Patria Mori`, is called ***The old Lie***, which shows Owen's opinion about war and dying in war: it's all nonsense.
