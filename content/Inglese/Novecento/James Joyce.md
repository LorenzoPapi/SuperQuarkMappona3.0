## *Dubliners*

It doesn't have a unitary plot. It consists of **15 short stories** about lives of **ordinary people in Dublin** that live **moments of intensity**, arranged in **four categories**:
- **childhood**: *The Sisters*, *An Encounter*, *Araby*,
- **adolescence**: *Eveline*, *After the Race*, *Two Gallants*, *Two Boarding House*,
- **maturity**: *A Little Cloud*, *Counterparts*, *Clay*, *A Painful Case*,
- **public life**: *Ivy Day in the Committee Room*, *A Mother*, *Grace*, *The Dead*.
The last story is considered to be his **first masterpiece** and represents both the **summary and climax** of the whole collection.
#### Eveline
It describes the life of a **19 year old girl** who has the opportunity to **change her routine life** by **leaving Dublin for Argentina** with her lover **Frank**. While she's in her room thinking about the **aspects of her life** that are driving her away, she hears an **organ grinder** outside whose melody reminds her of the one that was playing when her mother died and of the **promise she made to her**: to look after the house. At the dock where she and Frank are **ready to embark** she becomes **paralysed**.
### Themes and style
***Paralysis*** is a recurrent theme: it is both **physical** (external forces) and **moral** (religion, politics, culture). However, the moral centre of the collection is the **revelation of is** to its victims, and in particular the **failure of finding a way out of it**. Climax is reached by **self-realisation** and **awareness**: the desire to **escape** originates from an **impulse caused by the sense of confinement** that many experience, but nobody can **overcome**. This manifestation is called ***epiphany*** and it's caused by objects or situations.

Every story is told by the **perspective of a character** and starts in ***medias res***. The characters themselves are **presented through introspection**, making time subjective, and in particular:
- **free indirect speech** is used when the **thoughts are presented directly** through limited mediation by the narrator
- **free direct speech** allows the reader to **acquire direct knowledge of the character's mind**: language **breaks down** into a **succession of words** without punctuation or grammatical connections

Linguistic registry is varied and depends on **age, social class and role**, descriptions are **realistic and concise**, but realism is often mixed with **symbolism**, giving deeper meaning to external details.
