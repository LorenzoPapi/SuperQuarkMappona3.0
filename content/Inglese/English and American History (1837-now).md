# The beginning of Victoria's reign
**Alexandrina Victoria** was born in London in **1819**. Daughter of **Prince Edward**, she succeeded her **uncle William IV** to the throne when she was 18 and ruled for **64 years**. In **1840** she married her cousin **Albert** and had nine children from him: this devoted couple was seen an **exemplary model** of family. In **1861** Albert suddenly **passed away**.
## Social reforms
The first years of her reign were full of **social and political reforms, scientific progress** and **imperial expansion**; this happened thanks to the **constitutional regime** the Queen was perpetrating, which avoided the 1848 revolutions to take place in England too:
- the **Great Reform Act** (**1832**) extended vote to all male members of the middle class
- this act caused the working class to **gather around “Chartism”**, a movement based on the **"People’s Charter"** (**1838**) which asked for **better work conditions**
- the **10 hours Act** (**1847**), apart from improving work conditions, it also gave them the **right to vote**
On a political level, the two parties were **Liberals**, coming from the **Whigs**, and the **Conservatives**, coming from the **Tories**; the Liberals promoted a **_Laissez-faire_** economy that led to the repeal of the **Corn Laws** (**1846**).
## Foreign policy
The British economical empire expanded because of the **need for goods**: there were **two Opium wars** against China which gave Britain access to the **Honk Kong** port; Britain then fought side to side with **France** against **Russia** during the **Crimean War**; however, the most lucrative zone was **India** and when a crisis broke out because of the **bad government of the East Indies company**, the queen **dissolved it** and put India directly under the British government, promising Indians **same rights as the other British subjects**.
## Society and contradictions
By 1850, British people stayed preminently in **towns** because of the extraordinary **industrial development**; the main goal of the Victorian debate was to find a solution to **overcrowding** and to fight against the rising of **diseases and crimes** in the poorer zones of the cities. Some laws were passed to clean up the disasters of colera and typhoid but the changes were **very slow**. **Workhouses** were instituted to help the homeless, the poor and all the miserables in exchange for **labor**. Modern hospitals were built to improve the **research in medicine** and the cities were renewated with **street lights**, **paved roads**, **public entertainment places** and much more.
As we can see, the Victorian age wasn’t only sunshine and rainbows: on one hand it was an age of **progress** and **wealth** of the upper classes; on the other it was characterised by **poverty** and **injustice**. The Victorians were **great moralisers** and promoted values that reflected their **ideal reality**, not the real one, based on **duties**, **hard work**, **respectability** and **charity**. Respectability implied the **possession of good manners**, the **ownership of a house** with servants and carriage, **charitable activities** such as **philantropy**. The family life was **dominated** by this ideals: it represented a **patriarchial unity** where women were limited to the **education of children** and the **management of the house**. Also, society **marginalised unmarried mothers** because they were seen as impure and **sexuality was repressed**, both in the act and in the words.
## Philosophical and scientific discoveries
One of the most important publications in natural philosophy of the 19<sup>th</sup> century is **_“On the Origin of species”_ 1859** by **Charles Darwin**: thanks to the **notes** he had taken during his **five-year expedition around the world** to analyse and classify **all the species** he encountered and by following the works of **Lyell** and **Chambers**, he concluded that **all species were related** and that **nature was inclined to favor the strongest over the weakest**, potentially showing that **God** had no role in the **creation of Nature**. Of course, Darwin didn’t answer about **the origin of life** and he himself thought that this question was “**beyond the science of his time**” and for some people it was easy to **reconcile religion and Darwin’s findings**.

## The fictional novel
Thanks to the spreading of **circulating libraries**, the number of readers grew exponentially. The first means of publishing were the **instalments in the periodicals**, which allowed the writer to **feel in touch with the readers** constantly. The **novel** became the **most popular form of literature**:
- it had a **moral aim**: the writer felt the duty to **communicate social injustices** and to describe society **as they saw it** throught their **ideals and morals**;
- the **omniscient narrator** erects a rigid **barrier** between **“right”** and **“wrong”**;
- the **plot** was often **long and complicated**, usually solved only in the **last chapter** were the bad was **punished** and the good **rewarded**;
- the **setting** was often the **city**, symbol of the **industrial revolution** as well as expression of **anonymous lives** and **poverty** of the **lower classes**;
- the **characters were realistic** so that the reader could **identify themselves in them**.
The most famous British writers were **Charles Dickens** and the **Bronte sisters**; in general, lots of writers were **female**, but had to use a **male pen name** to get their books published; unsurprisingly, the majority of readers were **female**, because obviously they spent **more time at home** than men.
# The late years of Victoria's reign (1861-1901)
After her **husband’s** **death**, the queen **withdrew** from society. The political scene was dominated by the **Liberal Party** led by **Gladstone** and the **Conservative Party** led by **Disraeli**, who alternated as **Prime Ministers** until the end of the century.
## Social changes
The country was changing and this change was bringing **uncertainty**: for the first time, people lived **more in towns** than in the country, the population was **sky-rocketing** and reforms were passed to **improve life conditions**:
- the **“Artistans and Labourers Dwellings Act”** allowed the authorities to **clear the slums** and provide **housing for the poor**
- the **“Public Health Act”** provided **sanitation**
- the **“Factory Act”** limited working hours
- the **“Education Act”** established a **national primary education system**
- the **“Trade Union Act”** legalized worker unions 
- the **“Third Reform Act”** introduced the **secret ballot** and extended **vote to all male householders**.
## Foreign policy
The British Empire achieved its **biggest expansion** during this time, thanks to the **free trade policy** and **liberalism**: India was considered the **jewel of the Empire** and the queen became **Empress of India**; the British later controlled **South Africa** after winning the **Boer wars** in 1902. This age of florishment and prosperity came to an end with the **death of the Queen** in **1901**.

## Ideology of the time
While material richness was huge in this era, during the last decades of the 19<sup>th</sup> century **ideological conflicts** started **undermining the positive attitude** of the people. There was a **growing pessimism** characterizing intellectuals and artists who where **doubtful** about **society’s stability**.
They started going **against industrialisation** and one of the most prominent protester was **Karl Marx**, who wrote ***Das Kapital*** in London, and whose ideas were the foundation for the **Fabian Society** (1884): it aimed at transforming British society into a **socialist state** through gradual reforms. These ideas were later expressed by the **Independent Labour Party**.
Pessimism was reinforced by **Social Darwinism**, the **application of Darwin’s theory** to the **human society**, proposing the idea that **races**, **social classes** and **nations** were subject to the **“survival of the fittest” principle** and that the poor and oppressed **didn’t deserve compassion**.

# America and the civil war (1861-1901)
Political **tension** grew in the States from the **economic differences** between the northern and southern states: the former were **industrialized**, while the latter were **agricultural dependent** and still relied on **slaves** for hard labour. After the 1830s, lots of the northern states had **abolished slavery**: they organised themselves in the **Republican Party** and demanded that slavery had to be **excluded everywhere**.
When their candidate **Abraham Lincoln** won the elections (**1860**), the Southern states **seceded the Union** and formed the **Confederate States of America** guided by **Jefferson Davis**. The right to secede was **denied** by Lincoln and the **Civil War** broke out (**1861**). It ended with the **Northern victory** (**1865**) and the **assassination of President Lincoln**; poet **Walt Whitman** wrote ***O Captain! My Captain!*** reflecting the **emotional impact** that the event caused.
Victory meant that the USA would remain **indivisible** and that **slavery was abolished** by the **13<sup>th</sup> Amendment** of the Constitution. After the war, the differences **still remained** and big fortunes were made by **fully exploiting the country’s resources**: men like **John Rockefeller** became from **rags to riches**, embodying the new **_American dream_** of the **self-made man**. However, most workers were **exploited** and started **organizing themselves** in the **American Federation of Labour** to protect their rights. The abolition of slavery meant the slaves were **free** but **without home or money**: some migrated in the North, others **remained with their masters** now poor and were **segregated**.
# The Edwardian age (1901 - 1910)
After the **death of Queen Victoria**, her son **Edward VII** succeeded to the throne. He brought new energy to the **stagnant monarchy** of the last years of Victoria's reign and took the **German surname Saxe-Coburg-Gotha**. After his death succeeded by his son **George V** who changed his surname to **Windsor** (1917) in response to **anti-German** feeling.
## Foreign policy
By being **related to most royalties**, he was able to assist in **foreign policy negotiations**, such as the ***Entente Cordiale*** (April 1904), and formed strong bonds with **Russia**.
## Social policy
During his reign, the ***Women's Social and Political Union*** was founded (1903) to fight for the **right to vote** for women. Then, the **Labour party** was created (1906) and the **Liberals** won. They took steps towards the creation of a **welfare state**, a government in which the **State takes responsibility in the well-being of the citizens**: a **national insurance scheme** was introduced together with a **pension system**. However, there were **protests** low wages and high taxes: to counter them, the liberal **Lloyd George** proposed the ***People's Budget***, a law which called for a **land tax** and an **increased taxation** on the wealthy; the **refusal** of the House of Lords caused a **constitutional crisis** which led to the reform of the House itself.
